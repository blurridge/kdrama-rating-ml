    "# **Analyzing and Predicting K-Drama Trends based on Top 250 Performing Series**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this data science project, we will analyze the top 250 performing K-drama series to identify trends and patterns in relation to their ratings. We will use various data analysis techniques to extract insights from the data, such as identifying the most popular genres, tags, casts, air times, networks, and content ratings, as well as the factors that contribute to a series' success. Based on this analysis, we will develop a predictive model to forecast the popularity of future K-drama series. The goal of this project is to provide valuable insights for the K-drama industry and help content creators and broadcasters to better understand and target their audience.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The questions we seek to answer in the Exploratory Data Analysis portion are:**\n",
    "1. Which networks garnered the highest and lowest average ratings?\n",
    "2. Which production companies achieved the highest and lowest average ratings?\n",
    "3. Which genres are the most popular? least popular?\n",
    "4. Which actors and/or actresses rank high? rank low?\n",
    "5. Which directors rank high? rank low?\n",
    "6. Is there a correlation between episode duration and ratings? \n",
    "7. Is there a connection between episode number and ratings?"
